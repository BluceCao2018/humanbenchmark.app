## Conclusion

Understanding the relationship between stress and reaction time is crucial for optimizing performance in high-pressure situations. While some stress can enhance reaction time temporarily, chronic stress significantly impairs performance. Regular testing using standardized reaction time tests helps monitor the impact of stress and the effectiveness of management strategies.

Remember that individual responses to stress vary significantly. Developing personalized stress management techniques and regularly monitoring their effectiveness through reaction time testing is key to maintaining optimal performance under pressure.
